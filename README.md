# SQC - Squibsies Callouts

This is a collection of callouts for the popular GTAV mod FivePD (built upon FiveM).
I havee made ethe decision to release the source of my callouts to hopefully help other callout developers and community members create further content for the community. I will however state, I am not a professional coder or anything. I do not profess that this is the 'right' way to do things, it just works. If you have improvements, please do explain to me!

Please feel free to use this pack (you can find the compiled callouts on the GTA Police Mods FivePD section), and use elements of the code for your own callouts. However, please credit me in any releases.

While I may be able to offer some help, I cannot habitually offer support or guidance for this pack or your own development.
